# Bidhub

An eBay alternative built on a modern tech stack

## Development

Clone repository

Open project in IDE and fill in the `.env.template` and remove the `.template` suffix. (should be `.env`)

From your terminal:

```sh
cd bidhub
pnpm install
```

If the `pnpm install` doesn't show anything to do with Prisma, then also run
```sh
pnpm dlx prisma generate
```

Will update with more...
